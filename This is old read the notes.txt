I have recompiled under DCCservo project.


two modes.  one is servo set up, uses serial commands

second is dcc runtime.  no need to support cv commands, this is handled through setup

there will be 6 servo channels.  each can be assigned a dcc address, which means we can pair servos to respond to same address
will also be able to invert the 'sense' of each

the program command is
s pin, address, swing range, invert
e.g.
s 9, 1, 25, 0
means nano pin 9 given address 1 with 25 degrees swing either side of neutral, 0 = non inverted


and the instruction command is
p address, thrown|closed|neutral
e.g. p 1, t|c|n

neutral is 90 degrees mid swing and used when setting up the turnout

can use c string strtok with space and comma separator

system responds ok if it has interpreted the command


The swing speed is hardcoded, one degree every 15mS seems to be fine. little point making this programmable.
a 50 degree full range will take 750mS to execute.


the firmware builds an array of turnouts and assigns the pins.
